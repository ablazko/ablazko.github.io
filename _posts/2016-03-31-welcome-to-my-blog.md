After a hard day of work I was finally able to create my blog website. I'm really excited to start writing and sharing about my researches, R codes and strategies to tackle this interesting subject area which is data science and predictive modeling.

I'm also glad that <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> allow us to create such things all for free!

The contents of my postings will be a balance between theory and application. I will also try to share R codes to accomplish some goals and help us in this journey.

Some postings might also be related to subjects and contexts still under investigation, so there will be times that you'll find more questions than answers. Hopefully, by sharing these discussions the community can help us to find the best answers. Or at least the reasonable paths and strategies to address such issues.

I hope this blog can help you to improve your skills related to data science. And I hope also improve my own skills when we start exchanging ideas and knowledge through discussions in each posting.

Anyway, welcome to my blog! ;-)
